# data_mining_project
The aim of the project is to predict the market values of football players by using a ridge regression model.
I worked on a tabular dataset, which is taken from the game FIFA 23, that consists of general information about players (age, team, position etc.) and, various scores that gives insights about strong and weak sides about their styles.
